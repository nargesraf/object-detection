# Object Detection Project

This project focuses on detecting multiple types of objects in images and video streams using deep learning models such as YOLO, SSD, or Faster R-CNN.

## Features

- Detects objects in real-time or from static images
- Supports YOLOv3, YOLOv5, and other state-of-the-art models
- Outputs bounding boxes with class labels and confidence scores
- Easy-to-use and highly customizable

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- OpenCV
- PyTorch
- NumPy

You can install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

How to Run

Detect objects in an image:

python detect_objects.py --image path/to/image.jpg

Detect objects in real-time using webcam:

python detect_objects.py --webcam

Example Output



Dataset

You can train or test the models using popular datasets such as:

COCO

Pascal VOC

Custom datasets (in YOLO format)
